# README

This is a JavaScript boilerplate to get started quickly on a CodinGame challenge. Use this with the Codigame Sync tools (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codingame-sync-ext/ldjnbdgcceengbjkalemckffhaajkehd && https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codingame-sync-app/nmdombhgnofjnnaenegcdehnbkajfgbh).

## Test flow

Run `npm run test` to start the tests.

## Reproduce a state locally

Copy/Paste the state of the game in the state variable (near the `Paste the state` comment).
Run `npm run local` to start the program.

## Debug flow

Copy/Paste the state like in the `Reproduce a state locally` section.
Run `npm run debug` to start the program. In Chrome go to `chrome://inspect` and click on `Open dedicated DevTools for Node` to open the dev tools for Node.js.
You can then launch the profiler or place your breakpoints and click `Resume script execution`.
